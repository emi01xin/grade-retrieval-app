# Online Grade Retrieval Application

This is a client/server network application that can be used by a course instructor to distribute grades. 

The server software would be run by the course instructor and is given access to a database of student grade records. The client software would be run by a student and communicated with the server in order to retrieve this information. The server encrypts the data sent so that only the requesting client can decrypt the server response. 

Coded in Python using Berkeley/POSIX socket API.
